PixelQuotes-2
-------------

This is a continuation of Pixel Random Quotes Images by David Belicza (jamijami).

I was having trouble when setting up caching for my pages.  The Pixel widget would
write a random image/quote into the page and this would cause the browser cache
to invalidate the page stored.

This plugin continuation uses JavaScript to choose and display the random image/quote.
An array of images/quotes/links/authors is pulled from the database, encoded
to JSON, and passed to a JavaScript function.  This function randomly chooses an
image/quote and displays it in exactly the same format as the widget did.

It speeds up the page loading now.
